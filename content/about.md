Hi, I'm Chris. This is my blog. I write on topics related to my work: I'm cofounder
and CTO at [`Amplified`](https://www.amplified.ai/). In a past life, I was an innovation
economist with a focus on climate change policy. My desire to integrate the text
data available in patents with econometric analysis led me to go down an extremely
deep rabbit hole: machine learning. Which then led me to founding a company, which
then led me to learn a lot more about being a dev than I ever expected. So that
brings us here, where I write mostly about machine learning/data science in Elixir,
Rust, and Nix.
